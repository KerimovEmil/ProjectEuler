# Lucy_Hedgehog from https://projecteuler.net/thread=10;page=5#111677
# Here is a solution that is more efficient than the sieve of Eratosthenes.
# It is derived from similar algorithms for counting primes.
# The advantage is that there is no need to find all the primes to find their sum.
#
# The main idea is as follows: Let S(v,m) be the sum of integers in the range 2..v that remain after sieving with all
# primes smaller or equal than m. That is S(v,m) is the sum of integers up to v that are either prime or the product
# of primes larger than m.
#
# S(v, p) is equal to S(v, p-1) if p is not prime or v is smaller than p*p. Otherwise (p prime, p*p<=v) S(v,p) can be
# computed from S(v,p-1) by finding the sum of integers that are removed while sieving with p. An integer is removed in
# this step if it is the product of p with another integer that has no divisor smaller than p. This can be expressed as
#
# S(v,p)=S(v,p−1)−p(S(v/p,p−1)−S(p−1,p−1)).
#
# Dynamic programming can be used to implement this. It is sufficient to compute S(v,p) for all positive integers v
# that are representable as floor(n/k) for some integer k and all p≤√v.
