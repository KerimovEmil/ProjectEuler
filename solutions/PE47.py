PROBLEM

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 * 7
15 = 3 * 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 2*2 * 7 * 23
645 = 3 * 5 * 43
646 = 2 * 17 * 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors. What is the first of these numbers?

ANSWER: 134043
