PROBLEM

Let a_n be the largest real root of a polynomial g(x) = x^3 - 2^nÂ·x^2 + n.
For example, a_2 = 3.86619826...

Find the last eight digits of sum_{i=0}^{30} floor(a_i^987654321)

# Note that every linear relation has a corresponding generating function
# u_(n+3) = 2^n * u_(n+2) - n * u_(n)
# this corresponds with g_n(x) = x^3 - 2^n x^2 + n
# The roots of the cubic are the solutions to u_n = k_1 * a_1^n + k_2 * a_2^n + k_3 * a_3^n

# Note that all the roots of g_n(x) add up to 2^n
# proof:
# p*(x-a1)*(x-a2)*(x-a3) = p*(x^3 - (a1+a2+a3)*x^2 + (a1*a2+a2*a1+a3*a1)x - (a1*a2*a3))
# Note that all the sum of squared of all the roots of g_n(x) add up to 4^n
# proof:
# we know: (a1+a2+a3) = 2^n and (a1*a2+a2*a1+a3*a1) = 0
# hence: (2^n)^2 = 4^n = (a1+a2+a3)^2 = a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2 + 0


# ALSO NOTE: That since the other two roots are less than 1, we can look at the recursive
# relation instead of floating point exponentiations.

# And the following recurence relation: u_(n+3) = 2^n * u_(n+2) - n * u_(n)
# u(0) = 3, u(1) = 2^n , u(2) = 4^n
# will have the functional solution of:
# u(n) = a1^n + a2^2 + a3^n
# Since a2 and a3 are less than 1, for large n, they will contribute almost nothing to the value
# therefore for large n, u(n) ~= a1^n

# a1 falls under a bigger branch of numbers called Pisot numbers. Whose algebraic conjuguates are all
# less than 1 in magnitude
