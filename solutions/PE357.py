PROBLEM

Consider the divisors of 30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.
It can be seen that for every divisor d of 30, d+30/d is prime.

Find the sum of all positive integers n not exceeding 100,000,000
such that for every divisor d of n, d+n/d is prime.

ANSWER: 1739023853137
Solve time ~27 seconds
"""

# Since 1 is always a divisor of n, then
# 1 + n/1 = 1 + n = prime

# n must be even
# since if n is odd then every divisor d must be odd then
# d + n/30 = odd + odd = even != prime if the prime > 2. Which holds for n > 2.

# n is square free
# since if n = p_1 * p_2^2 then choose d = p_2
# p_2 + p_1*p_2 = p_2 * (1 + p_1) != prime.

# combining the last two findings we have, n%4 can only be 0 or 2 since n needs to be odd,
# however since n is squarefree, n%4 can only be equal to 2

# combining this with the fact that n + 1 must be a prime, it results in us only needing
# to loop over primes such that p%4 == 3
