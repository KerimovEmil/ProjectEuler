PROBLEM

The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square roots are:
sqrt(2) = [1;(2)], period=1
sqrt(3) = [1;(1,2)], period=2
sqrt(5) = [1;(4)], period=1
sqrt(6) = [1;(2,4)], period=2
sqrt(7) = [2;(1,1,1,4)], period=4
sqrt(8) = [2;(1,4)], period=2
sqrt(10) = [3;(6)], period=1
sqrt(11) = [3;(3,6)], period=2
sqrt(12) = [3;(2,6)], period=2
sqrt(13) = [3;(1,1,1,1,6)], period=5

Exactly four continued fractions, for N<=13, have an odd period.

How many continued fractions for N<=10,000 have an odd period?

ANSWER: 1322
Solve time: ~0.1 seconds

Textbook reference: Algebraic Number Theory by Frazer Jarvis, Section 8.2 Continued Fractions of Square Roots

Theorem 8.12 The continued fraction of ≥d has the form [b0; b1,..., bk ] where bk = 2b0.

Theorem 8.15 Let d > 0 be an integer, not a square. Then the equation x2−dy2 = 1 has infinitely many solutions.
The equation x2 − dy2 = −1 has infinitely many solutions if the continued fraction for ≥d has odd period.

If l(N) is odd then N has no prime factors of the form 4k + 3 and is not divisible by 4.
