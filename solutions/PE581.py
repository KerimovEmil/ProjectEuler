A number is p-smooth if it has no prime factors larger than p.
Let T be the sequence of triangular numbers, i.e. T(n) = n(n+1)/2

Find the sum of all indices n such that T(n) is 47-smooth.

ANSWER: 2,227,616,372,734
Solve time: ~24 seconds

Key Idea:
St√∏rmer's theorem - that is, all P-smooth consecutive numbers can be generated using the solution to Pell's equation
x^2 - dy^2 = 1.
Essentially, for every squarefree 47-smooth q not equal to 2, we solve sufficiently many solutions to x^2-dq y^2 = 1
For each solution, (x-1)/2 is a candidate for this problem's n.

See here for more details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%B8rmer%27s_theorem

Using that theorem and https://oeis.org/A117581 we get:
 the upperbound on consecutive 47-smooth numbers is 1,109,496,723,126
