PROBLEM

Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because

3600 = 48^2 +   36^2
3600 = 20^2 + 2×40^2
3600 = 30^2 + 3×30^2
3600 = 45^2 + 7×15^2

Similarly, we find that 88201 = 99^2 + 280^2 = 287^2 + 2×54^2 = 283^2 + 3×52^2 = 197^2 + 7×84^2.

In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.
We are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:

n = a_1^2 +   b_1^2
n = a_2^2 + 2×b_2^2
n = a_3^2 + 3×b_3^2
n = a_7^2 + 7×b_7^2,
where the a_k and b_k are positive integers.

There are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 10^7.
How many such numbers are there that do not exceed 2×10^9?

# Extending the number field of the reals with a field extension of sqrt(D), n = a + b sqrt(D)
# such that Norm(a + b sqrt(D)) = a^2 - D×b^2
# Note that there are only the following negative D for which the resulting field is a principal ideal domain (PID)
# D = −1, −2, −3, −7, −11, −19, −43, −67, −163
# However only the field extensions of D = −1, −2, −3, −7, −11 are Euclidean domains.
# The remaining fields, D = −19, −43, −67, −163 are rare examples of PID's that are not Euclidean domains

# For reference: commutative rings ⊃ integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ GCD domains ⊃
# unique factorization domains (UFD) ⊃ principal ideal domains (PID) ⊃ Euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ finite fields

# For reference: the only D's for which the field extension is a Euclidean domain are
# D = −11, -7, -3, -2, −1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73

# Using the Legendre symbol (-1/p) = {1 if p==1 mod 4, -1 if p==3 mod 4}
# In other words -1 has quadratic residues if p == 1 mod 4

# we can use legendre symbol arithmetic, (a/p)*(b/p) = (ab/p) to prove a lot more of these quadratic residues.
# We get:
# -1 has quadratic residues if p == 1 mod 4
# -2 has quadratic residues if p == 1,3 mod 8
# -3 has quadratic residues if p == 1 mod 3
# -7 has quadratic residues if p == 1,2,4 mod 7

# Therefore if p == 1 mod 4 AND p == 1,3 mod 8 AND p == 1 mod 3 AND p == 1,2,4 mod 7
